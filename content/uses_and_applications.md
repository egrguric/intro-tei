# What can you do with TEI?

TEI is highly flexible, and encoded documents can be used in many ways: for digital presentation (such as digital editions of texts), programmatic analysis, enabling linked data, text searching in databases, and more. All this is enabled by the _structured_ nature of TEI, and the human- and computer-readability of encoded texts. This allows other programs and scripts to then turn an encoded text into much more. 

## Examples of applications

### Example 1: [Text encoding for Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven (Tanya Clement, 2009)](https://digital.lib.umd.edu/transition/index.html)

This example uses poems written by the excentric German-American writer Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven. The project created by Tanya Clement in 2008 takes the .tiff scans of the original, handwritten poem and compares it to a reworked second version of the poem. The encoded transcriptions make it possible to compare line changes--for example.

### Example 2: [Wilde Trials International News Archive](https://dhil.lib.sfu.ca/wilde/index.html)

Here we see newspaper transcriptions, in various languages, of the Wilde trials. The goal of this project was to compare similarities iin either language and to search transcriptions. 

### Example 3: [Colonial Despatches](https://bcgenesis.uvic.ca/index.html)

In this example, the goal was to make a direct comparison between the scanned image and transcription. 

### Example 4: [Map of London](https://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/)

The Map of London seeks to identify landmarks and find resources for each landmark.


## Advantages of TEI

* Human and computer-readable: E.g. using the element `<language ident="en-GB">` tells to computer that the item is in British English – 
but it’s also relatively easy to see that it’s about language and the codes are intelligible.
* XML documents are easily shared. Researchers can take someone’s TEI file and enrich it, for example by adding extra detail or transcriptions. 
* The structured nature of TEI records means (at least in theory) that records can be worked with at scale to support big data analysis or text data mining
