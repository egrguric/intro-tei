# What does XML look like? How is it constructed?

Understanding the anatomy of XML is crucial to working with the TEI guidelines. In an XML file (which includes your XML file encoded using TEI guidelines), there are a few elements you need to have to ensure the document is **well-formed** (valid according to XML rules). Take a look at this example:




Each start tag in vaid XML has to have a corresponding end tag. Think of the Russian Matryoshka dolls: they need a top and a bottom part in order to function. Thatâ€™s how we make sure information is contained in the right place under the right tag.

For elements in an XML document that are **nested**, the inner element needs to be properly closed off first (similar to HTML). For example, <tutorial><topic>XML</topic></tutorial> is valid but <tutorial><topic>XML</tutorial></topic> is not.

XML documents need to have a root element, which is the parent of all the other elements. With TEI XML, this element is generally <TEI>. 

There are a couple of other rules as well, but these are the main ones. When it comes to the actual work of encoding your text, the editor you're using to mark up your text will often have a feature to help check if your document is valid. A tool like Oxygen will also help identify the problem by providing some additional information. Depending on the tool, you might also have the option to select a **template** that will have many necessary elements in place for you.
