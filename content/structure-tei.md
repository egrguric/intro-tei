So what does an XML document encoded using TEI guidelines look like? Let's refer back to this visual that explains the difference between XML and TEI:

Again, XML provides the syntax, which we're starting to pick up on: how elements are used, how tags are structured, and so on. The TEI guidelines offer a set of rules that express certain types of ideas, using XML syntax: in other words, it provides vocabulary and guidelines for the highly flexible XML. For instance, TEI says that `<p>` is what you should use to denote a paragraph in your text.
